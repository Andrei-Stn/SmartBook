# SmartBook

In this mobile application I made a library in which the books are being taken from Firebase in a pdf format along with the cover and the description of the book.
I implemented a pdf reader for displaying the pdfs.
The application has the following functionalities: 
- online and offline book reading through downloading the book in the application memory
- dark mode for reading
- bookmark and favourtie button
- book categories

In this application I used the following technologies:
Java, Android Studio, Firebase, Room
